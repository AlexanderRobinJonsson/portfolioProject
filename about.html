            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Alexander Robin Jonsson. I am a front-end developer with a background in graphic design and electromechanical engineering.</p>
            <p>I specialize in building user interfaces that are visually compelling and engineered for precision and reliability.</p>
            <p>My journey into the digital world began with a <strong>three-year education in graphic design</strong>, where I developed a keen eye for aesthetics, branding, and user-centric communication. While I loved shaping the visual experience, I was driven to bring these designs to life with interactivity and function. This ambition led me to pursue a comprehensive <strong>diploma in Full Stack Development</strong>.</p>
            <p>I undertook this program while working as an <strong>Electromechanical Technician</strong>. This parallel experience was invaluable, as my daily work with technical machines and schematics grounded my web development studies in the principles of engineering and systematic problem-solving.</p>
            <p>Having explored full stack, I realized that my passions for design and function converge most powerfully in front-end development. I completed the <strong>Frontend Developer React</strong> program in Bor√•s (Sweden) to master modern client-side technologies. Today, I leverage this blended background to create web solutions that are thoughtfully designed, structurally sound, and built to perform.</p>
