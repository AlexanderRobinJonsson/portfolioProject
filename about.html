            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm Alexander Robin Jonsson, a front-end developer with a unique foundation in graphic design and electromechanical engineering. My passion is building intuitive user interfaces that are not only visually compelling but also engineered for precision and reliability.</p>
            <p>My journey into the digital world began with a <strong>three-year education in graphic design </strong>, where I developed a keen eye for aesthetics, branding, and user-centric communication. While I loved shaping the visual experience, I was driven to bring these designs to life with interactivity and function. This ambition led me to pursue a comprehensive <strong>diploma in Full Stack Development<strong>.<p>
